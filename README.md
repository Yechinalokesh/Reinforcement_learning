# 🥟 Bhukkad Bhai's Reinforcement Learning Adventure! 🌶️

🚀 **Live Game**: [Click Here to Play! 🎮](https://yechinalokesh.github.io/Reinforcement_learning/)  
🍽️ *Help Bhukkad Bhai find the Legendary Golden Samosa using brainy moves and tasty strategies!*

## 🤔 What Is This?

Welcome to a **hilarious take on Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, where you don’t train robots or agents in mazes...  
You train **Bhukkad Bhai**, the eternal foodie, to *strategically chomp his way through a samosa-packed map*!

This isn’t just another boring RL tutorial. This is:

## 🎮 How to Play

### 🧭 Objective:
Guide **Bhukkad Bhai** from **Home** to **Samosa Swarg (Samosa Heaven)** by choosing the best path across a grid of tempting (and tricky) locations.

### 🗺️ Map Locations:
- `H` → Home Sweet Home 🏠  
- `M` → Market Mayhem 💸  
- `G` → Gully of Gossip 🗣️  
- `C` → Chai Stall Corner 🍵  
- `T` → Temple o' Temptations 🛐  
- `A` → Aroma Avenue 🤤  
- `S` → SAMOSA SWARG 🥟✨ *(Goal)*

### 📏 Rules:
- Bhukkad Bhai can move **only to adjacent cells** (N, S, E, W).
- Each move **costs stamina** 🪫 and can **increase/decrease yummy points** 😋.
- Some places give snacks 🍪. Others drain energy like nosy aunties at Gully Gossip 🙃.
- Reaching `S` ends the game. But are you a **greedy gobbler** or a **wise wanderer**?

## 🧠 RL Concepts Behind the Crunch

### 🤖 Agent:
Bhukkad Bhai = Your lovable (and very hungry) agent.  
He makes decisions based on current position and past experience.

### 🌍 Environment:
The **grid** is the environment — each cell has hidden rewards (positive or negative) and stamina costs.

### 🎯 Goal:
Maximize **total yummy points** before Bhukkad Bhai *passes out from hunger*.

### 🔄 States:
Each place (`H`, `M`, `G`, etc.) is a **state**. Moving to a new location transitions you to a new state.

### 🏃 Actions:
Move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Simple, but every move could make or break your snack streak.

### 💸 Rewards:
- Market Mayhem: +5 yummy  
- Chai Stall: minor boost  
- Gully of Gossip: -25 (curse of chitchat!)  
- Aroma Avenue: close to victory  
- Samosa Swarg: +100 🎉

### 🔁 Learning:
In real RL, you'd use Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks, or SARSA to train Bhukkad Bhai to choose optimal paths.

## 😂 Why This Game?

Because **RL is hard** and **samosas are delicious**. So why not learn both?

This game demonstrates:
- State transitions
- Reward engineering
- Optimal policy pathing
- Tradeoffs between risk (low stamina) and reward (high yummy)
- Decision-making under uncertainty  
All in a *funny*, *snackable* format! 🍴

## 👨‍💻 Technologies Used

- HTML + CSS + JavaScript (Frontend)
- GitHub Pages (Hosting)
- Pure **human brain logic** 🍔 (No ML libraries… yet 👀)

---

## 🔮 Future Work

- Add RL algorithm visualization (Q-values, policy heatmap)
- Add more levels/maps (Biryani Bazaar, Pizza Planet, Dosa Dungeon?)
- Implement real Q-learning backend
- Leaderboards for Bhukkad Bhai clones 🍔👯‍♂️

---

## ✨ Final Note

This game isn’t just about code — it’s about creativity, culture, and **making learning fun**.

If you smiled even once reading this README…  
**YOU are ready to become a Reinforcement Learning Rockstar.**
